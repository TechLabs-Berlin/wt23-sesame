SESAME is an app that is designed to help the user to bundle their spending in a structured way and to show their spending behavior using key figures. Output can be entered by the user or captured manually via a scanning function combined with optical character recognition. By assigning categories, the expenses can be grouped, statistics can be derived and a deeper understanding of one's own spending behavior can be obtained.
