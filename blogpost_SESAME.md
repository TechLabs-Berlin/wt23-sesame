*Receipts cause clutter, but contain useful data that is easily lost.*  
What can I do about this if I want to record the information on my receipts in a structured way in order to get an overview of my expenses, to be able to call them up without much effort and to better understand my spending behavior?
**you can use SESAME.**

## Introduction
SESAME should help you to bundle your expenses in a structured way in one app. With your own account you can keep track of your receipts. You can assign each of your receipts to a category of your choice, such as "Shopping", "Groceries", "Travelling", "Rent" etc., with the value, date and place of issue. You can enter your receipts manually, or you can import a photo of your receipt from which Optical Character Recognition can recognize the relevant information (output value, date, output location and, if applicable, category). The user gets his expenses summarized in a weekly or monthly view. For the selected period, the categories with the largest output values are listed below the view. This way you can keep track of your expenses in the long run and no longer have to keep piles of paper or worry about not being able to find a receipt.
