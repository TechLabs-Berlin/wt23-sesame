## Summary: 

SESAME is an app that is designed to help the user to bundle their receipts in a structured way and to show them their spending behavior using key figures and statistics. Receipt informations can be entered by the user or captured manually via a scanning function combined with an optical character recognition algorithm. By assigning categories, the expenses can be grouped, statistics can be derived and a deeper understanding of one's own spending behavior can be obtained.

### App Feature: 
- Capture and store receipts with mobile camera using scan and OCR
