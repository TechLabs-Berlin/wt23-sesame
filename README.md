**SESAME** is an app that is designed to help the user to bundle their receipts in a structured way and to show them their spending behavior using key figures and statistics. Receipt informations can be entered by the user or captured manually via a scanning function combined with an optical character recognition algorithm. By assigning categories, the expenses can be grouped, statistics can be derived and a deeper understanding of one's own spending behavior can be obtained.

## App Features:

- Capture and store receipts with mobile camera using scan and OCR
- Receive receipts with a QR Code-reader
- Manual receipt entry
- Categorize expenses
- View statistics on spending behavior
- Select a specific date or time frame to view expenses and receipts within that time
- User authentication and authorization (Signin/Login)

Please note that this is a prototype and some of the features are still a work in progress or not yet started in development.
